For a while now I've been thinking about what I actually do for a job. When a stranger asks me what I do I say "I work in IT", easy enough.

However if someone in IT asks me what I do I try to give a more precise answer. I find that my answer changes depending on who they are and what I'm currently working on. I'll probably say something like "I'm a Sysadmin", "I do DevOps", "I'm a Software Engineer", "I work in R&D" and so on.

If I try and fill in my skills on my LinkedIn profile I end up putting things like "Python", "Linux", "Docker", "Puppet", "Git", "HTML", "Public Speaking", "Wordpress" and "Red Hat Linux". It is a total mash of things, some are deep subjects, some are shallow, some are technical and some are soft skills. Some of them are even duplicates with subtle differences. They are all things I can and have done professionally but they don't all fit into a single category or role.

## DevOps

DevOps is one of the phrases that has made me really think about this. Until DevOps came along I often thought of myself as a sysadmin who had previously been a developer. Therefore my primary focus was managing linux systems, but I could also build and improve the tools used by myself and others.

Then when the term DevOps became more popular some people started suggesting thats what I was, or maybe even an OpsDev because of my priorities at the time. I immediately disliked this, it felt like it was a label for the sake of a label and it seemed to make some people rather angry. People who considered themselves expert developers or ops engineers said that DevOps were cowboys, and DevOps considered the nay-sayers to be archaic and outdated. As usual with this things, both are probably wrong.

In a startup or small business it is totally feasible that a developer will have to manage an entire system themselves, but this isn't because it is a good way to work, it is out of necessity. In a large organization silos develop naturally, someone writes code, someone else builds servers, someone else deploys the code on the server, etc. This again is out of necessity because the task has grown too big for a single person to manage.
